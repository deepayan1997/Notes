question:Importance of manifest.yml file in sap btp
ans)The manifest.yml file is important in SAP BTP (especially the Cloud Foundry environment) because it acts as a deployment descriptor, specifying how an application should be deployed, configured, and managed in the cloud.

Purpose and Role:
The file contains key deployment details such as app name, buildpacks, memory allocation, environment variables, services, routes, and other settings.

Using manifest.yml simplifies deployment: instead of supplying configuration flags each time via CLI, you define everything in the file, making deployments consistent and easily reproducible.

Benefits for Projects
It can be tracked in source control, enabling teams to maintain deployment configuration alongside code, supporting collaboration and traceability.

Manifest files support automation and CI/CD pipelines, providing a single source of truth for deployment requirements and reducing manual errors when moving apps between environments.
